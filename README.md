# Node Centric Graph Learning From Brain Data 
In this repository, we have modified GraphSAGE representation learning code in many ways to implement our proposed 
"Node-Centric Graph Learning" algorithm from data. We use the proposed algorithm for brain state identification and more specificly, 
seizure detection. 

The ECoG recordings are from the EU data collection which is not accessible to public. Hence, little changes is needed to apply the algorithm on arbitrary datasets.

Please start reading the codes from "main.py" file. The "supervised_tasks.py" contains majority of high-level and important
functions of this project.
